# Website3

A starter website, to be used with the code generated by Code Generator 3 (see https://github.com/capesean/codegenerator3)

To get started:
- Download the zip file and extract the contents into a folder on your machine.
- Open the solution file with Visual Studio
- Edit the appsettings.json file, setting the DefaultConnection connection string to a valid SQL Server. Set the database (Initial Catalog) to the name you want the database to be created with.
- Run the project (F5).

It should create the database using Entity Framework migrations, and open a browser at URL https://localhost:44401/

The app should then redirect the website to the Setup page, from where you can enter your details to get an Administrator login to the system.

Note that the API is hosted on URL https://localhost:44501/ - this is to allow the API (back-end) to be rebuilt without having to restart the front end.

If you are using CodeGenerator3, you can then create your own entities (POCO classes) and fields, relationships etc. Then you can deploy the code from there directly into this project, if you have correctly configured the CodeGenerator path to correctly find/use the path to this project.
